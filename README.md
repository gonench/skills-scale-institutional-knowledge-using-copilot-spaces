# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

This folder centralizes OctoAcme's project management process documentation. Use it as your starting point for how we initiate, plan, execute, release, and improve cross-functional work.

## Overview of Project Management Processes

OctoAcme delivers projects through a structured, iterative approach built around five stages: initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospective. Each project starts with formal validation of the business need and stakeholder alignment, captured through a Project One-pager documenting the problem, goals, success metrics, and initial risks. Planning transforms approved initiatives into prioritized, estimated backlog items with clear acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done, managed via kickoff meetings, risk registers, and milestones.

Execution centers on disciplined team rituals supporting transparency and momentum—daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, demos/reviews at sprint milestones, and a visible project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done). Teams work in small PRs, enforce CI testing and approval before merge, and track progress with metrics and dashboards. Blockers escalate from team-level triage, to PM/Product Lead, and ultimately sponsor intervention for critical risks.

Roles are well-defined: Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and communications; Product Managers own outcomes and prioritization; developers implement and test; QA validates releases against acceptance criteria. Communication follows a predictable cadence—PM+PdM weekly syncs, team standups, stakeholder updates, and weekly status templates. Risks and blockers are managed in a living risk register, reviewed weekly, with clear escalation paths.

Quality assurance is built-in at every step: automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end), security scans, and manual QA precede all releases. Releases follow a checklist of requirements, with preflight and post-deploy verification steps, and incident playbooks for quick rollback and root cause analysis. Retrospectives after milestones and incidents produce actionable learnings, tracked and prioritized for continuous process improvement.
